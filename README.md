### Coding Instructions
* There are 4 classes namely:
  * Owner
  * Pet
  * PetManager
  * PetManagementSystem

* You can create additional classes if that will help you solve this problem
* Create atleast 3 kinds of Pets.
* Create multiple owners, each of which can own different kinds and a specific number of pets (i.e. three or five)
* Implement interfaces for behaviors like Playable or Feedable to show different ways pets can interact or be cared for.
* Pets can have mood states affected by actions like playing or feeding, impacting their responses and behaviors.
  * A hungry pet can be happy after being fed.
  * A sad pet can be happy after playing with the owner.

Please read the guide comments for each class for you to move forward!
